        <p>
            This page is about my Cat, Binky. I got Binky in 2012 when she was 1 year old. No one wanted to take her home and month after month her foster family would take her to be adopted. I knew the moment we met that she was special. She was born feral and I wasn't sure she would acclimate to domestic life. Most people don't like black cats and posess a deep prejudice. I wanted to make her a website to highlight her and show how special she is to me. She loves being playful, and as you can see from the gallery she loves to follow shadows. (See photos) Her favorite type of food is wet food, Seafood flavor in particular. I wanted to create and use my website to highlight how fun and adorable Binky is.
