        <h1>Habitat</h1>
        <div class="habitat">
            <p>Cats are a cosmopolitan species and are found across much of the world. Geneticist Stephen James O'Brien, of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland, remarked on how successful cats have been in evolutionary terms: "Cats are one of evolution's most charismatic creatures. They can live on the highest mountains and in the hottest deserts." They are extremely adaptable and are now present on all continents except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islandsâ€”even on isolated islands such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerguelen_Islands">Kerguelen Islands</a>.

                Binky lives in my apartment. She has a cat playhouse I purchased for her. She also likes to crawl inside anything that has clothes where she can burrow herself into a safe, cave-like area. I often find her hiding in closets, inside of boxes, or inside of dressers.

        <h2>Feral Cats</h2>
        <div class="feral">
            <p>Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands. Their habitats even include small oceanic islands with no human inhabitants. Further, the close relatives of domestic cats, the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and the Arabian sand cat (Felis margarita) both inhabit desert environments, and domestic cats still show similar adaptations and behaviors. The cat's ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to its designation as one of the world's worst invasive species.

                Binky was a feral cat. Some feral cats never warm to human interaciton. Luckily for me, Binky and I have a special bond.

        <h2>Domestic Cats</h2>
        <div class="domestic">
            <p>As domestic cats are little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary">Hungary</a> and possibly also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula.</a>
