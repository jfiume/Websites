        <div class="cats">
            <p>
                The domestic cat (Latin: <em>Felis catus</em>) is a small, 
                typically furry, carnivorous mammal. <br>
                They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets
                or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.<br>
                Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.<br>
                There are more than 70 cat breeds, 
                though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

                Binky likes to sleep and play. She is an indoor only cat even though she was born a feral cat. She is very playful and often runs around with her toys.

            Binky likes certain people. Most people, especially new people, scare her. Only after spending a tremendous amount of time around new people, will Binky allow someone to pet her or pick her up.
